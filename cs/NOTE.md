# Stomp in C#

This is unfinished, and ~~likely~~ never will be, as C# seems to have built in
option handling (or I am stupid), which would remove the need for this program.
I have left it here for the sake of showing what I was trying to do the first
time, which could explain some of the main java code better than my ~~lack of~~
comments.
